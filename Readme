                     Project Title - SDP: A Secure Dynamic Password System
                     Contributors - Amal Yousseef, Shravanthi Manohar, My Huynh

We propose a secure dynamic password system that generates different login information each time a user tries to login to the system, so that 
the information sent over the channel will be different for each login trial. Our proposed system contains four stages, namely, Registration Stage, Login Stage, Authentication Stage and Password Change Stage.
We use Diffie-Hellman protocol for Encryption.
